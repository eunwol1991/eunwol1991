## EPUB Converter

Use `epub_converter.py` to batch convert folders of Chinese novel `.txt` files into EPUB books. Simply run the script and provide the input and output folders when prompted.

```
python3 epub_converter.py
```

The program will ask for the folder containing the text files and the folder to store the EPUBs. Every `.txt` file will be converted with the font set to **SimSun**. You can also supply the folders with `--input` and `--output` options to skip the prompts.
